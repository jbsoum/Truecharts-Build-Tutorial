# Add the TrueCharts Catalogs to Your System

----

See [this guide](https://truecharts.org/manual/SCALE/guides/getting-started/#adding-truecharts) from TrueCharts to get the right catalogs added
- You'll need at least ```stable```, ```enterprise```, and  ```operators``` trains
- The ```incubator``` train is for what can be considered 'beta' charts, use them at your own peril.
