# Step 3: Accessing the Web GUI
1. After removing the USB and rebooting the system, you should be presented with the Console Setup screen

{:style="counter-reset:none"}
1. At the top of this screen is the local IP address of the Web GUI

1. From any computer on the same network as your TrueNAS server, you should be able to enter that address and see the Web GUI Login Screen
