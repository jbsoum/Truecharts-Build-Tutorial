# Truecharts-Build-Tutorial
An all inclusive guide for setting up a secure apps ecosystem using Truecharts. Current guide uses TrueNAS SCALE Cobia for the build. 
Based on [these guides](https://truecharts.org/manual/SCALE/guides/getting-started) from TrueCharts, with some extra learned lessons and tips.
By the time you get to the end, you should have a completely set up, secure, and remotely accessible homelab.
You should also have everything you need to add and remove apps from this setup as needed

## Initial Requirements

1. **A system capable of running a homelab server**
    - See here for recommended system requirements from TrueNAS: [TrueNAS - SCALE Hardware Guide](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/23.10/gettingstarted/scalehardwareguide/)
    - See here for recommended system requirements from TrueCharts: [Truecharts - Recommended System Requirements](https://truecharts.org/manual/systemrequirements/)
    - Learn from my mistakes, and pay heed to the requirement that your **apps run on a separate SSD pool with at least 250GB**
      - I built out a bunch of apps on a regular HDD mirrored pool and could not transfer everything over to an SSD pool, using **any kind of backup / restore methodology**
    - For your boot pool, consider an SSD drive of at least 32GB
      - People used to use thumb drives for these, but I think these days, TrueNAS will [burn those out quick](https://www.truenas.com/community/threads/truenas-on-usb-drive.91273/)
      - 16GB will be for the OS, and an additional 16GB can be used as a swap partition
    - For your data pool, consider RAIDZ1/2/3 or mirrored VDEVs
      - Internet searches will produce many opinions on whether you should go with Z1/2/3 or mirrored pools.
      - Basically, mirrored pools sacrifice capacity (at least half of your space will be redundancy) in exchange for speed
      - In terms of redundancy, RAIDZ2 is probably ideal
      - In terms of performance, mirrored vdevs are faster, and I personally use them
    - For RAM, ECC RAM has always been [highly recommended](https://www.truenas.com/community/threads/truenas-on-system-without-ecc-ram-vs-other-nas-os.107611/) for ZFS systems
      - Consider 1GB of ECC RAM per TB of total space in your pool.
      - Add an additional 16GB for the apps.
      - For example, if you have a mirrored vdev pool with 2 8TB HDD drives
        - You want 8 GB for the space, and an additional 16 GB for the apps, so at least 24GB of ECC RAM
    - Consider a system with hot swap bays
      - These make life easier, both for replacing failed drives, and installing new ones
    - Overall system minimums
      - A system with *at least* 5 HDD bays (ideally hotswap bays [seriously, trust me, hotswap bays make life much easier])
        - One for the Apps pool
        - One for the Boot pool
        - 2 for the storage pool
        - One additional as a spare slot (trust me, it's super helpful to have this!)
      - A processor with at least 4 CPU cores
      - At least 16 GB of ECC RAM, plus 1GB of ECC RAM for each TB of available space in your pool

2. **A system running TrueNAS SCALE**
    - See here for Cobia 23.10 install instructions: [TrueNAS Installation Guide](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/23.10/gettingstarted/)

3. **A working internet connection**
    - you should be able to ping github and truecharts *from your TrueNAS server*:
  ```
  ping https://github.com
  ```
  ```
  ping https://truecharts.org
  ```
  ```
  ping https://tccr.io
  ```

4. **A working SSH connection so that you can access your TrueNAS terminal remotely**

5. **TrueCharts catalogs [added to the repository](https://truecharts.org/manual/SCALE/guides/getting-started/#adding-truecharts)**

-----

## Part I: Setting up the TrueNAS System

-----

### Step One: Set up TrueNAS SCALE Bootable USB
1. First, download the installer from here, this should be the latest Cobia build: [Download TrueNAS SCALE](https://www.truenas.com/download-truenas-scale/)
2. Next, you'll want to burn this to a thumb drive, using something like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) on Windows.
3. If on Windows, use [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) to burn the iso to the USB and skip to step 8.
4. On Linux, you'll want to follow the instructions below, pulled from here: [Preparing the Install File](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/23.10/gettingstarted/install/installingscale/#preparing-the-install-file)
5. Connect your empty USB drive and run this command in the terminal of the Linux machine you downloaded the TrueNAS iso to:
```
lsblk -po +vendor,model
```
6. In the ```NAME``` colum, you'll see the mount path of the USB. Use that in the command below:
```
dd status=progress if=path/to/.iso of=path/to/USB
```
7. Once this command completes, you'll have a bootable usb.
8. Plug this into your server, and enter bios (usually mashing something like F12 at the bootup screen)
9. In the BIOS screen, select the option to boot from your thumb drive. This should launch the TrueNAS Installer Console Setup. 


### Step Two: Install TrueNAS from USB and set up the administrator account
See here for the guide on first time setup of TrueNAS: [TrueNAS Installer Console Setup](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/gettingstarted/install/installingscale/#using-the-truenas-installer-console-setup)
1. Select **Install/Upgrade**

![SCALE Install Main Screen](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Install/SCALEInstallMainScreen.png)

2. Select the desired install drive

![SCALEInstallDriveScreen](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Install/SCALEInstallDriveScreen.png)
    
- You want to make sure you select the SSD drive you want to use as your boot drive

Select **Yes**.

![SCALEInstallWarningScreen](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Install/SCALEInstallWarningScreen.png)

3. Select **Fresh Install** to do a clean install of the downloaded version of TrueNAS SCALE. This erases the contents of the selected drive!

![SCALEInstallUpgradeFresh](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Install/SCALEInstallUpgradeFresh.png)

When the operating system device has enough additional space, you can choose to allocate some space for a swap partition to improve performance. Select **Create Swap** and press Enter.

![SCALEInstallPartitionScreen](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Install/SCALEInstallPartitionScreen.png)

When existing versions of TrueNAS are present on the device, you can choose **Install in new boot environment** to create a partition or **Format the boot device** to remove previous boot environments.

![SCALEInstallUpdateMethodSelection](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Install/SCALEInstallUpdateMethodSelection.png)

4. Select option **1 Administrative user (admin)** and then **OK** to install SCALE, and create the admin user account. SCALE Bluefin has implemented rootless login. Create an admin account and password. The system retains root as a fallback but it is no longer the default. This account has full control over TrueNAS and is used to log in to the web interface. Set a strong password and protect it. We do not recommend selecting **3 Configure using Web UI**.
![SCALEInstallerConsoleSetupAdminAccount](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Install/SCALEInstallerConsoleSetupAdminAccount.png)

Next, enter a password for the new admin user.

![SCALEInstallerConsoleSetupAdminPassword](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Install/SCALEInstallerConsoleSetupAdminPassword.png)

5. Select Boot via UEFI at the TrueNAS Boot Mode prompt, then select OK and press Enter to begin the installation.

After following the steps to install, reboot the system and remove the install media.

-----

### Step 3: Accessing the Web GUI
1. After removing the USB and rebooting the system, you should be presented with the Console Setup screen

![ConsoleSetupMenuSCALE](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/CLI/ConsoleSetupMenuSCALE.png)

2. At the top of this screen is the local IP address of the Web GUI

3. From any computer on the same network as your TrueNAS server, you should be able to enter that address and see the Web GUI Login Screen
    - For example, if your Web GUI is at ```https://192.168.1.10:443```, enter that into a web browser on a computer connected to the same network as your server
  
![LoginScreenSCALE](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Login/LoginScreenSCALE.png)

4. Enter the administrator username and password you set up in **Step Two**

5. At this point, you should be logged into the TrueNAS Web GUI!

6. Let's take a quick break, we've accomplished a lot at this point üòåüëçüèº

7. *After your break*, check this guide out for a detailed explaination of everything you can do in the Web GUI: [TrueNAS SCALE - UI Reference Guide](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/scaleuireference/) 

-----

### Step Four: Set up the SCALE Network

1. **Set up the TrueNAS Scale Network**
    - Go to *Network*, and for the interface (ethernet port) which is connected to the internet, all the way to the right, click the little pencil icon to Configure

![NetworkInterfacesWidget](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Network/NetworkInterfacesWidget.png)

- Under *Aliases*, set the IP Address to your desired local IP address for your server
    - This IP can or cannot be outside of your DHCP range
    - The DHCP range on your router is the range of IP addresses reserved for automatic assignment when someone new connects to the network
    - If you're going to run apps off of this server, you really should have a static IP
    - We'll set it here, in TrueNAS, then set it up on your router as well
- Save these settings

- Still in the *Network* tab of the Web GUI, click on *Settings* to the right of *Global Configuration*

![GlobalConfiguration](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Network/GlobalConfiguration.png)

- The *Hostname* and *Domain* define the local address of your server
    - The *Hostname* is the network name of your server
        - ```truenas``` is a typical choice  
    - The *Domain* is the network address of your server. You can enter additional domains as well
        - I like to start with ```truenas.local``` for the domain, and then if I have an external domain I would access remotely, I would add that under *Additional Domains*.  
    - For example, if you select ```truenas``` for *Hostname* and ```local``` for *Domain*, you can access your server at ```http://truenas.local```
- For *Nameserver 1* and *Nameserver 2*, you can use ```1.1.1.1``` and ```1.0.0.1```, these are Cloudfare's default DNS servers
    - When you get DNS services from Cloudfare, they give you special DNS domains for your server, you could use those too I guess, but I don't think it matters.
- For *IPv4 Default Gateway*, enter the IP address you would use to log into your router. That's your default gateway. For many, that's ```192.168.1.1```.
- For *Outbound Network*, make sure *Allow All* is selected.
- Save these settings.

![EditGlobalConfiguration](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Network/EditGlobalConfiguration.png)

2. **Set a static IP address for your server on your router**
    - This is the IP address you set for the interface above in Step 2
    - You typically also need the MAC address for your interface
    - You can get that running the command below in the TrueNAS shell under *System Settings*
    - You should a bunch of sections, one of them will be labeled with the name of the interface you set an IP address for in Step 2 above.
    - In that section, there should be a line that looks something like ```ether ax:3g:8c:04:07:v8```. That string of alphanumeric characters and colons is your MAC address
    - You may also need your hostname, which you also set in Step 2 above.
```
ifconfig -a
```

-----

### Step Five: Set up Terminal Access
- The idea here is that you're unlikely to have a monitor attached to your server at all times
- There is a Shell you can access via the web GUI, but you should not expose that to the internet, and it's a bit finicky
- So, without a monitor, how can you interact with the terminal? What if you're away from your desk?
- Enter SSH! You don't want to open your server up to the internet, but *if we can create a secure tunnel between the server and whatever machine we're on, that should be pretty secure*!
- I understand that SSH is cryptic for those unfamiliar with what it is or how it works, so I'll try to demystify the process

- The idea is that you, the client, wants to generate a set of keys, a *public key* and a *private key*
- The public key is like your address, it lets other people know who you are
- The private key is the secret algorithm that's used to encrypt your connection with whatever device you are connecting to, aka the server
> **NEVER SHARE YOUR PRIVATE KEY WITH ANYONE** ü§´

- See below for a helpful picture from [ssh.com](https://www.ssh.com). You are the client, trying to connect to the server via SSH.

![A visual of how SSH works...you are the client, trying to ssh into the server...](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/SSH_simplified_protocol_diagram-2.png)

Let's walk through the steps required to generate a set of host keys for your laptop, or desktop, or whatever device you want to use to connect to your server.
You can set up more than one device, but setting that up is a bit more complex. If you're here, you're probably not ready for all of that yet.
We're going to use OpenSSH, which is available by default on Linux or Mac. 

If you're on Windows, here's some helpful instructions for getting OpenSSH up and running on the command line: [Microsoft - OpenSSH instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=gui)
If you can't stand OpenSSH, there is also Putty, if you want, I guess.

1. **Forward a port for your SSH connection on your router**
    - This step is different for everyone depending on your router, search for ```Port forwarding <YourRouterNameAndModel>```
    - You'll want to forward *some port above 40000*,
       - ***Why are we doing this?*** Well, 22 is the default port for SSH connections, and it's a popular one for hackers to try and break into
       - We are going to keep that port closed, and open up another random port instead for SSH connections
       - This is more secure
    - Use TCP only,
    - For IP address to forward to, use the static IP address you selected for your server.
    - We'll come back to this port forwarding screen for your router to give other apps remote access as needed
  

3. **Set up the SSH Service in TrueNAS**
   - Go To *System Settings* -> *Services*

![ServicesSCALE](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/SystemSettings/ServicesSCALE.png)

   - Make sure the *SSH*, *NFS*, and *SMB* Services are *Running*, and are set to *Start Automatically*
   - On the *SSH* line, all the way to the right, click the little pencil icon to Configure SSH.
   - Set the TCP port for SSH to be *the port you forwarded on your router in Step 1*.
    - Enable *Allow TCP Port Forwarding*
    - Do NOT enable *Password Authentication*
        - **Why are we doing this?**
        - We are going to set up access via SSH, so we can keep our system extra secure by making sure the *only way* to access the system remotely is with a valid SSH key registered with the server
    - Save these settings

![ServicesSSHBasicSettingsGenOptionsSCALE](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/SystemSettings/ServicesSSHBasicSettingsGenOptionsSCALE.png)

4. **_On the client machine (the machine you'll be accessing the server from)_, generate an ssh key with ssh-keygen**
```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -c <your@email.address> -f /path/to/save/your/private/key
```
- **-t ed25519**: The encryption algorithm - this is the most advanced one available in OpenSSH
- **-c \<your@email.address\>**: Key comment - this will be appended to the end of your public key
    - it's for your records, it can be whatever you want, or you can omit it
- **-f /path/to/save/your/private/key**: The Private Key File Name - **This is the thing you don't want to share with anyone!**
    - The typical place to save these is in the ```.ssh``` directory.
    - This can be found in ```/home/<YourUsername>/.ssh/``` on Linux and MacOS
    - On Windows, this can be found in ```C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.ssh\```
    - I recommend naming the key something easy for you to remember. This helps to keep track of multiple keys.
        - For example, ```/home/<YourUsername>/.ssh/root@example.com```
        - This tells us we use this key to login to our server at ```example.com``` as the user ```root```.
    - OpenSSH will create an additonal file called **/path/to/save/your/private/key _.pub_**.
        - For example, if you named your private key  ```/home/<YourUsername>/.ssh/root@example.com```,
        - then your public key will be ```/home/<YourUsername>/.ssh/root@example.com.pub```
- After the key is generated, you'll see a cool ASCII graphic, then you'll be asked:

> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]

> Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]

- If you leave both of these fields empty, then your SSH key can be used without a password. **I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS**.
- Lock your key with a secure password. That way, no one can use your key to gain access to your server without that passphrase.

5. **Register your key with SSH Agent**
- Run the below command to get ssh-agent running:
```
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

- You should see something like ```Agent pid 12345``` returned.
- Next, add the key to ssh-agent with the following command:
```
ssh-add /path/to/save/your/private/key
```
> You want to register your **private key** here, not the public one ending in *.pub*

     
6. **Still on the client machine, run the below command, which will return your client machine's public key**
```
cat /path/to/save/your/private/key.pub
```
- So, whatever your public key's name is, we are going to return its contents to the terminal screen
> Do NOT do this with your private key! ü§´
- Copy this by selecting it in the terminal, holding ```CTRL``` + ```SHIFT```, and press ```C```.
     
7. **Register this key with your admin account**
    - Note that if you are upgrading from a previous version of FreeNAS / TrueNAS, you're probably using hte ```root``` account as your admin account
    - This is being deprecated in future releases, so be prepared to use a separate admin account for all of your root stuff as this guide suggests eventually...
    - Go to  *Credentials* -> *Local Users*, and select your admin account for editing

![UserScreenUserDetails](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Credentials/UserScreenUserDetails.png)

- In this screen, we are going to paste the public key we copied in Step 5, and paste it in the *Authorized Keys* section

![AddUserHomeDirAuthSCALE](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Credentials/AddUserHomeDirAuthSCALE.png)

- Make sure *SSH Password Login* is **UNCHECKED**
    - **Why are we doing this**?
    - Wellll, we don't want to use passwords to gain SSH access with the server.
    - The only way in should be a secure key known by the server, further secured with a password on the client side.

8. **Now, you should be able to log into your server remotely using the command below**:
```
ssh <YourAdminAccount>@<YourServerDomain> -p <YourSSHPort>
```

-----

## Part II: Pool Setup
If you've been following along so far, you should be able to go to Storage in the TrueNAS GUI and see *at least* 3 unassigned disks.
One of those disks should be an SSD that's at least 256GB, and the other 2+ should be mechanical drives. 

### SSD Pool - where your apps will go
Click the **Create Pool** button in the ***Storage*** tab of the TrueNAS GUI.

1. **Select a name for your SSD pool**
    - People tend to choose something simple, all lower case without dashes or underscores
    - For the purpose of this tutorial, well assume this pool is called ```ssd```
    - Leave the drive unencrypted
    - Click *Next*

![PoolCreationWizardGeneralInfo](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Storage/PoolCreationWizardGeneralInfo.png)

2. **Add the SSD to your pool**
    - For *Layout*, select *Stripe*
    - Click *Manual Disk Selection* under *Advanced Options* 
    - In the top right corner, click *Add* to add the only VDEV we'll need for this pool
    - Select the SSD disk for your pool on the left, and drag it into your new VDEV on the right
    - If you have a lot of disks, feel free to use the disk filters to help parse down the list to find your disk
        - We will be setting up backups of our app directory, so disk redundancy isn't super necessary for this pool
        - If you must, you can set up a 2-way or 3-way mirrored VDEV
    - Click *Save Selection*, then click *Save and Go To Review*
     
![ManualSelectionScreen](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Storage/ManualSelectionScreen.png)

3. **Review your selection and create your pool**
    - *Pool Name* should be what we set above, (eg ```ssd``` as in our example)
    - *Data* under *Topology* should say something like ```1 x STRIPE|1 x #.## GiB (SSD)```
    - If everything looks good, go ahead and click *Create Pool*

![PoolCreationWizardReviewScreen](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Storage/PoolCreationWizardReviewScreen.png)

### Storage Pool - where your data will go
At this point, we assume you have at least 2 unassigned disks left, all mechanical drives.
For your storage pool, consider RAIDZ1/2/3 or mirrored VDEVs
  - Internet searches will produce many opinions on whether you should go with Z1/2/3 or mirrored pools.
  - Basically, mirrored pools sacrifice capacity (at least half of your space will be redundancy) in exchange for speed
  - In terms of redundancy, RAIDZ2 is probably ideal
  - In terms of performance, mirrored vdevs are faster, and I personally use them


1. **Select a name for your storage pool**
    - People tend to choose something simple, all lower case without dashes or underscores
    - For the purpose of this tutorial, well assume this pool is called ```storage```
    - Leave the drive unencrypted
    - Click *Next*
  
2. **Add the HDDs to your storagepool**
    - For *Layout*, select your chosen redundancy framework (hopefully NOT Stripe if you've been listening to me!)
    - Under *Automated Disk Selection*, select the *Disk Size* that matches the size of your mechanical drives
    - Under *Width*, this depends on your redundancy framework
        - RAID Z1/2/3 is essentially 1 VDEV per pool
        - Mirrored will create one VDEV per mirror
        - Mirrors need to have at least two disks per VDEV
        - So for a 2 way mirror (50% of HDD capacity spent on redundancy), select *2* for *Width*
        - For a 3 way mirror (66.7% of HDD capacity spent on redundancy), select *3* for *Width*
    - The *Number of VDEVs* will be limited by the number of disks you have and your redundancy framework
    - Click *Save and Go To Review*
  
![PoolCreationWizardDataScreen](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Storage/PoolCreationWizardDataScreen.png)

3. **Review your selection and create your pool**
    - *Pool Name* should be what we set above, (eg ```storage``` as in our example)
    - *Data* under *Topology* should say something like ```<V> x STRIPE| <W> x #.## GiB (SSD)```
        - <V> represents the number of VDEVs in your pool
        - <W> represents the width you selected
    - If everything looks good, go ahead and click *Create Pool*
  
-----

## Part III: Set up the Apps Cluster

-----

### Step One: Set up your Apps Pool

1. In the Web GUI, go to the Apps tab

![AppsInstalledAppsScreenNoApps](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Apps/AppsInstalledAppsScreenNoApps.png)

2. The first time you open the Applications screen, it displays an *Apps Service Not Configured* status on the screen header.

![AppsServiceNotConfigured](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Apps/AppsServiceNotConfigured.png)

3. Click *Settings* -> *Choose Pool* and select the ```ssd``` pool we created above for our Apps cluster

![AppsChoosePoolForApps](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Apps/AppsChoosePoolForApps.png)

4. After an Apps storage pool is configured, the status changes to *Apps Service Running*.


### Step Two: Add the TrueCharts catalogs to your system
See [this guide](https://truecharts.org/manual/SCALE/guides/getting-started/#adding-truecharts) from TrueCharts to get the right catalogs added
- You'll need at least ```stable```, ```enterprise```, and  ```operators``` trains
- The ```incubator``` train is for what can be considered 'beta' charts, use them at your own peril.

### Step Three: Add the base TrueCharts Operator charts
- In the TrueNAS Web GUI, go to the *Apps* tab, then click on *Discover Apps*
- You're going to install 3 charts from this screen: ```cloudnative-pg```, ```prometheus-operator```, and ```cert-manager```
- You'll find these apps on the TrueCharts operators train
    - Search for the chart name in the *Search Bar*
    - Click on the tile for the app that shows up
    - Click *Install*
    - The Chart Config screen will show up, click *Install* and leave the settings as default for these charts

You should see something like below in the Apps screen when you're done (3 apps that show *Running*)

![An image of the 3 operator apps running](link.img)

### Step Four: Install Heavyscript on your sever

Remember those fancy ssh credentials we made in a prior step? It's time to use those!

Open up a terminal or command line on the machine you set up security keys on (hopefully this one, lol)

ssh into your server using the following command:

```
ssh <admin>@your-server.domain -p <YourSSHPort>
```
- \<admin\>@your-server.domain: \<admin\> is your admin account you set up when you installed TrueNAS (or root if you upgraded from an older version)
- \<YourSSHPort\>: this is the port you set up on your TrueNAS SSH service, and forwarded on your router for this purpose
- If everything works, it should ask you for your SSH passphrase. Enter it, and you're logged into your TrueNAS terminal!

If that DIDN'T work, try the same command, using your server Static IP address we set above in TrueNAS's network configuration, and also on your router:

```
ssh <admin>@Your.Server.IP.Address -p <YourSSHPort>
```

If that ALSO DIDN'T work, something's wrong!
- If the IP address didn't work, is the machine you're trying to connect from on the same network as your server?
- Are you ***sure*** you forwarded that port on your router?
- Are you ***sure*** that's the same port you set up in *System Settings* -> *Services* -> *SSH*?
- Are you ***sure*** that's your TrueNAS Static IP address? Set up correctly in TrueNAS *Network* tab AND on your router? (check ```ifconfig -a``` in *System* -> *Shell*)
- Are you ***sure*** you entered your SSH passphrase correctly?
- Are you ***sure*** you copied your SSH public key's contents *entirely* and pasted them into the *Authorized Keys* section of your admin account in *Credentials* -> *Local Users*?

If that DID work, you should be greeted with a welcome message from your server, and a command prompt that looks something like this:
```
<admin>@<Hostname>[~]:
```
- \<admin\>: this is your administrator account (or root)
- \<Hostname\>: this is the hostname you set up in your *Network* settings
- [~]: this means you are at the ```home``` directory of your administrator account on your server. Whatever path you are currently at will be displayed in these brackets

NOW it's time to install [HeavyScript](https://github.com/Heavybullets8/heavy_script).
What is HeavyScript? It's a bash script for managing TrueNAS charts, very helpful companion with TrueCharts

From their github, you can install HeavyScript from the command line with just one line:
```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Heavybullets8/heavy_script/main/functions/deploy.sh | bash && source "$HOME/.bashrc" 2>/dev/null && source "$HOME/.zshrc" 2>/dev/null
```
Copy and paste that into your logged in ssh terminal, and press ```Enter```.

From [their github](https://github.com/Heavybullets8/heavy_script#how-to-install), this command will:

- Download HeavyScript, then place you on the latest release
- Place HeavyScript in ```/root```
- Make HeavyScript executable
- Allow you to run HeavyScript from any directory with ```heavyscript```

Check to see if the install went successfully by typing ```heavyscript``` into your SSH terminal. If you see HeavyScript launch, you're good to continue!

Let's finally add a Cron Job for HeavyScript. We want it to run automatically once a day and:

- update the HeavyScript app
- check for updates
- Create and store a backup of the apps cluster

Let's go to *System* -> *Advanced Settings*:

![SystemAdvancedScreen](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/SystemSettings/SystemAdvancedScreen.png)

In the *Cron Jobs* widget, click *Add*:

![AdvancedSettingsCronJobWidget](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/SystemSettings/AdvancedSettingsCronJobWidget.png)

In the *Add Cron Job* screen:

- *Run as User* = your administrator account
- *Schedule* = run daily at some time
- *Hide Standard Output*= unchecked (for email notifications)
- *Hide Standard Error*= unchecked (also for email notifications)
- *Command* = Use this to backup, update HeavyScript, and update any apps

```
bash /root/heavy_script/heavy_script.sh update --backup 14 --concurrent 10 --prune --rollback --sync --self-update
```

## Part IV: Set up a domain name for your server
Okay, great job! You made it really far!

Let's take a break from server stuff and create a domain name for our server!

What's that? You don't know anything about domain names?

### Step 1: Getting a domain name

Take a look at this quick lesson from [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org): [What is DNS?](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-dns/)

Basically, DNS is the system the internet uses to map IP addresses to domain names like https://your-cool-server.xyz

First, you're going to need a domain name. If you don't want to pay for one, you can use free services like [Freenom](https://www.freenom.com).
It should be noted that you don't have ownership or transfer rights over the domain you get from Freenom.

If you want your own snazzy domain, check out [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)

Once you have a domain, we're going to manage DNS services through [Cloudfare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). Don't worry, it's free for what we're using it for!

Here are some instructions from Namecheap on [how to use a 3rd party DNS service with your Namecheap domain](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/767/10/how-to-change-dns-for-a-domain/).
The process for other domain providers is similar.

You can also transfer ownership rights from Namecheap to Cloudfare, if you'd like. Here's a [guide from Cloudfare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-step-by-step-guide-to-transferring-domains-to-cloudflare/) on how to do that.

### Step 2: Resolving the domain through [Cloudfare](https://dash.cloudflare.com) DNS

Yeah, we're using Cloudfare. Why? Well, it's the only DNS service Truecharts currently supports, plus it's free for what we need it for. 
As TrueCharts grows their ecosystem, I'm sure there will be other options. 

Basically, we're going to add an ```A Record``` to link your server's IP address to your newly acquired domain

Later, we're going to add a ```CNAME Record``` for each app, with the URL convention \<app\>.\<your-snazzy-domain\>.com
The CNAME Record forwards requests made to a particular alias to a hostname or IP address of our choosing.

1. Create a free account at [Cloudfare](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
   
2. Upon joining, Cloudfare should be asking you to add a site. If you already had an account, there's a link for adding a site somewhere on the dashboard. Add the domain you acquired previously.

3. Don't do any of the paid stuff (unless you want to, ofc).
   
4. Once your domain is ready, click on it on your dashboard, and click on *DNS* in the left toolbar.
   
5. We're going to add an ```A Record``` here, click the *Add Record* button
    - Type: ```A```
    - Name (required):```<your-snazzy-domain>.<something>```
        - eg: ```example.com```
    - IPv4 address: ```<Your.Server.IP.Address>```
    - Proxy status: *Disabled*
    - TTL: *Auto*

6. That's it for now! We'll come back here later for a couple of things:
    - Generate an API Token to update our domains and aliases with Let's Encrypt certificates **automatically**
        - aka we don't have to remember when our ssl certeficates are expiring for each of our apps
        - AND each chart can get it's own automatically updated and validate certificate
        - we'll do that automatically with a Trueharts app we'll install on our homelab!
    - Add a ```CNAME Record``` for each app we want to access remotely
        - eg if we wanted to access the Whoogle chart, we would add a CNAME record for whoogle.your-snazzy-domain.something
        - once we set everything up, you should be able to access whoogle.your-snazzy-domain.com from anywhere with your credentials
     
Okay! Break time over! Let's get back to it!         

-----

## Part V: App Cluster Network and Remote Access Set Up

-----

Now that our apps cluster is up and running, and we have a shiny new domain name with a DNS service ready to resove our domain, let's set up our network access.

We'll want to set up a reverse proxy (```traefik```) that handles forwarding domain aliases (eg coolapp.shinyserver.com) to the apps in our cluster.

We'll also set up Single Sign On using an LDAP server (```lldap```) and authentication middleware (```authelia```). 
    - An LDAP server is essentially a single source of truth for usernames, passwords, and access groups for all of your apps and services which support LDAP. 
    - Users will be able to log into the LDAP server and update their passwords directly
    - The authentication middleware will look at the LDAP server to check usernames and passwords for access
    - Apss which support LDAP will also check the server for access, so users won't need a different set of credentials for each app in your cluster they want to access
    - Some apps will auto-create accounts for users with a valid LDAP entry if one doesn't exist already. 

By the time we make it to the end of this section, we should have a framework for assigning different levels of access to apps based on group membership, and a single source of truth for usernames and passwords for most or possibly all of your apps!

-----

### Step 1: Change the default ports for the TrueNAS Web GUI

1. Navigate to *System* -> *General Settings*, and click on the *Settings* button in the top-right of the *GUI* widget:

![SystemGeneralScreen](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/SystemSettings/SystemGeneralScreen.png)

2. Change *Web Interface HTTP Port* to ```81``` and *Web Interface HTTPS Port* to ```444``` and save
    - **Why are we doing this?**
    - Port 80 is the default port for external access to your network via the IP address via http, and 443 for https
    - When you type ```http://google.com```, for example, the default end point would be to port ```80```
    - If you typed ```https``` instead, that default end port would be ```443```
    - When someone types ```http://your-awesome-server.xyz``` into a browser, they will be presented with whatever service is available at port 80 on your network
    - If the above link was typed with ```https```, they would be presented with whatever service was available at port 443 on your network
    - With TrueNAS on your network, ***that's the Web GUI!***
    - We are changing that here, and we'll instead let ```traefik``` handle what services are presented when remote clients access those ports
  
The WebUI will now prompt you to restart the web server service, after which you will be automatically redirected to your dashboard through one of the new ports. 

If you are not prompted to restart the web server service, you may restart the machine and manually navigate to the WebUI address followed by one of the new ports 

eg. ```truenas.local:81```.

### Step 2: Disable SCALE's default LoadBalancer and install MetalLB instead

See here for a guide from TrueCharts: [TrueCharts: MetalLB Setup Guide](https://truecharts.org/charts/enterprise/metallb-config/setup-guide/)

1. Install ```metallb``` from the TrueCharts Operators train, use the default settings
    -  If you encounter an error, run the below command from terminal and try to install again from the Web GUI:

```
k3s kubectl delete --grace-period 30 --v=4 -k https://github.com/truecharts/manifests/delete
```

2. Once ```metallb``` successfully installs, *then you can install* ```metallb-config```

3. On the install screen, create a new entry under *Configure IP Address Pools Object*:
    - *Name*: Enter a general name for this IP range. Something like apps or charts for this field is fine.
    - *Auto Assign*: if you want MetalLB Services to auto-assign IPs from the configured address pool without needing to specify per app. Recommendation is to keep this checked. You can still specify an IP for apps as needed (see step 3).
  
4. Also on the install screen, create a single entry under *Configure Address Pools*:
    - *Address Pool Entry*: Specify an IP range for MetalLB to assign IPs that is OUTSIDE your current DHCP range on your LAN. For example, if your DHCP range is ```192.168.1.100-192.168.1.255```, then your entry can be any range below ```192.168.1.100```. This entry can also be specified in CIDR format.

![metallb_guide_addresspool_basic](https://truecharts.org/assets/images/metallb_guide_addresspool_basic-3a4c701591f41a719f49dc2879a662ca.png)

> For users with VLANs or multiple subnets, you may create create additional address pool objects as needed.

5. Also on the install screen, create a new entry under *Configure L2 Advertisements*.
    - *Name*: Enter a basic name for your layer 2 advertisement.
    - *Address Pool Entry*: This should match the name of the address pool created above (not the IP range itself).

![metallb_guide_l2advertisement](https://truecharts.org/assets/images/metallb_guide_l2advertisement-f957198af0975b52e0fa12f98b3c219c.png)

6. Finally, let's disable the Integrated Load Balancer by going to *Apps* -> *Settings*, then click on *Advanced Settings*, then uncheck *Enable Integrated Load Balancer*

> This will trigger a restart of Kubernetes and all apps. After roughly 5-10 minutes, your apps will redeploy using the MetalLB-assigned IP addresses.
    - You can verify that happened by running the command below in terminal:

```
k3s kubectl get svc -A
```

> If you have an IP conflict with a previously assigned address it will show as ```<pending>```. **Rebooting should fix this***

7. That's it! We now have a more functional load balancer for our apps cluster. You can delve more into ```metallb```'s configuration options here: [MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/configuration/)

8. **Why did we do this?**
    - SCALE's integrated Load Balancer doesn't allow us to specify unique IP addresses per apps, like you can with jails in TrueNAS CORE.
    - ```metallb``` gives us this ability
    - Now, when we set up an app, we can select *LoadBalancer* for apps we want to expose ports for, and *actually specify which IP we want the app to use*
    - We can also leave this blank, and per our config settings, ```metallb``` will select an IP from our allowed range

-----

### Step Three: Install Traefik for reverse proxy / ingress support

1. Go to *Apps* in the Web GUI, click on Discover Apps, and install ```traefik``` from the TrueCharts enteerprise train

2. On the *Install* screen, make the following changes under **Networking and Services**:

- **Main Service** - *Loadbalancer IP*: select an IP in the allowable range you picked for ```metallb```
- **TCP Service** - *Loadbalancer IP*: use the same IP you selected above 
- *web Entrypoint Configuration* > Entrypoints port: Change port 9080 to port 80
- *websecure Entrypoint Configuration* > Entrypoints port: Change port 9443 to port 443

3. Click *Install*, and we're done!
    - You can access your dashboard at the link in the *Notes* widget on the *Apps* tab for ```traefik```
    - The link is ```http://Your.Selected.Loadbalancer.IP:9000/dashboard/```
    - We'll come back here later to set up some authentication middleware
  
-----

### Step Four: Install Clusterissuer for automated Let's Encrypt certificates
See [this guide] from TrueCharts for reference

The purpose of this step is to set up ```clusterissuer```. What ```clusterissuer``` will do is request and renew certificates from Let's Encrypt for all of your apps that need them.

For anyone that has had to set up certificates *and renew them* on their own, this makes life much easier. 

Let's get to it!

1. **Set Nameservers for TrueNAS Server**
    - It is important to configure Scale with reliable nameserver to avoid issues handling DNS-01 challenges.
    - Under *Network* -> *Global Configuration*-> *Nameservers*, TrueCharts recommends setting ```1.1.1.1/1.0.0.1``` (*Cloudfare*) or ```8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4``` (*Google*).
  
![scale-network-nameserver](https://truecharts.org/assets/images/scale-network-nameserver-1f209b68ab798f9d7ab5c970c03d7619.png)

2. **Create a Cloudfare API Token for issuing Let's Encrypt certificates**
    - Go to the [Cloudfare API Tokens](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens) Dashboard
    - Click *Create Token*
    - Select *Edit Zone DNS template*.

![cf-apitokens-template](https://truecharts.org/assets/images/cf-apitokens-template-d2dbad789d3620a820755b23d0ac3ceb.png)

The recommended API Token permissions from TrueCharts are below:

![cf-apitokens-perms](https://truecharts.org/assets/images/cf-apitokens-perms-cd6fbf348c5782343cc757a76c719ac8.png)

- Save these settings, and Cloudfare will flash an API Token at you. Save this! We need it for the very next step.

3. **Install** ```clusterissuer```
    - Find ```clusterissuer``` in the TrueCharts enterprise train
    - In settings, make the following updates:
    - *Name*: Name this "cloudflareprod". This name will be used later in the app ingress configuration
        - It's possible to set up multiple DNS providers per app, we're setting up one for Cloudfare
        - Feel free to set up some of your own if you choose! 
    - *Type of DNS Provider*: Cloudflare
    - *Server*: Letsencrypt-Production
    - *Email*: The email address you register with Let's Encrypt for renewal/expiration notices
    - *Cloudflare API key*: Leave blank since API token will be used
    - *Cloudflare API Token*: Populate with token created from above.

![clusterissuer-appconfig](https://truecharts.org/assets/images/clusterissuer-appconfig-55e10076d3dec9b4f73f244a60a00e9a.png)

4. That's it! You should now be able to add "cloudfareprod" to any app installation to get auto-generated Let's Encrypt certificates.
    - See below for an example. You would replace ```cert``` with ```cloudfareprod``` if you've been following this guide
  
![clusterissuer-ingressconfig](https://truecharts.org/assets/images/clusterissuer-ingressconfig-cc09b0d1c68d0589d105f728f2521626.png) 

> Note!
> As part of the DNS verification process cert-manager will connect to authoritative nameservers to validate the DNS ACME entry. Any firewall or router rules blocking or modifying DNS traffic will cause this process to fail and prevent the issuance of certificates. Ensure no firewall or router rules are in place blocking or modifying DNS traffic to assigned authoritative nameservers. Below is an example of cloudflare assigned authoritative nameservers (these nameservers are unique to each user).

![cloudflare-nameservers](https://truecharts.org/assets/images/cloudflare-nameservers-6ac9cbf04b84c2f1c14c0be4dcd56ff4.png)

> Anoter Note!
> It is by design that the app does not run, there are no events, no logs and no shell.

### Step Four: Installing other apps
