# Truecharts-Build-Tutorial
An all inclusive guide for setting up a secure apps ecosystem using Truecharts. Current guide uses TrueNAS SCALE Cobia for the build. 
Based on [these guides](https://truecharts.org/manual/SCALE/guides/getting-started) from TrueCharts, with some extra learned lessons and tips.
By the time you get to the end, you should have a completely set up, secure, and remotely accessible homelab.
You should also have everything you need to add and remove apps from this setup as needed

## Initial Requirements

1. **A system capable of running a homelab server**
    - See here for recommended system requirements from TrueNAS: [TrueNAS - SCALE Hardware Guide](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/23.10/gettingstarted/scalehardwareguide/)
    - See here for recommended system requirements from TrueCharts: [Truecharts - Recommended System Requirements](https://truecharts.org/manual/systemrequirements/)
    - Learn from my mistakes, and pay heed to the requirement that your **apps run on a separate SSD pool with at least 250GB**
      - I built out a bunch of apps on a regular HDD mirrored pool and could not transfer everything over to an SSD pool, using **any kind of backup / restore methodology**
    - For your boot pool, consider an SSD drive of at least 32GB
      - People used to use thumb drives for these, but I think these days, TrueNAS will [burn those out quick](https://www.truenas.com/community/threads/truenas-on-usb-drive.91273/)
      - 16GB will be for the OS, and an additional 16GB can be used as a swap partition
    - For your data pool, consider RAIDZ1/2/3 or mirrored VDEVs
      - Internet searches will produce many opinions on whether you should go with Z1/2/3 or mirrored pools.
      - Basically, mirrored pools sacrifice capacity (at least half of your space will be redundancy) in exchange for speed
      - In terms of redundancy, RAIDZ2 is probably ideal
      - In terms of performance, mirrored vdevs are faster, and I personally use them
    - For RAM, ECC RAM has always been [highly recommended](https://www.truenas.com/community/threads/truenas-on-system-without-ecc-ram-vs-other-nas-os.107611/) for ZFS systems
      - Consider 1GB of ECC RAM per TB of total space in your pool.
      - Add an additional 16GB for the apps.
      - For example, if you have a mirrored vdev pool with 2 8TB HDD drives
        - You want 8 GB for the space, and an additional 16 GB for the apps, so at least 24GB of ECC RAM
    - Consider a system with hot swap bays
      - These make life easier, both for replacing failed drives, and installing new ones
    - Overall system minimums
      - A system with *at least* 5 HDD bays (ideally hotswap bays [seriously, trust me, hotswap bays make life much easier])
        - One for the Apps pool
        - One for the Boot pool
        - 2 for the storage pool
        - One additional as a spare slot (trust me, it's super helpful to have this!)
      - A processor with at least 4 CPU cores
      - At least 16 GB of ECC RAM, plus 1GB of ECC RAM for each TB of available space in your pool

2. **A system running TrueNAS SCALE**
    - See here for Cobia 23.10 install instructions: [TrueNAS Installation Guide](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/23.10/gettingstarted/)

3. **A working internet connection**
    - you should be able to ping github and truecharts *from your TrueNAS server*:
  ```
  ping https://github.com
  ```
  ```
  ping https://truecharts.org
  ```
  ```
  ping https://tccr.io
  ```

4. **A working SSH connection so that you can access your TrueNAS terminal remotely**

5. **TrueCharts catalogs [added to the repository](https://truecharts.org/manual/SCALE/guides/getting-started/#adding-truecharts)**

## Part I: Setting up the TrueNAS System

-----

### Step One: Set up TrueNAS SCALE Bootable USB
1. First, download the installer from here, this should be the latest Cobia build: [Download TrueNAS SCALE](https://www.truenas.com/download-truenas-scale/)
2. Next, you'll want to burn this to a thumb drive, using something like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) on Windows.
3. If on Windows, use [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) to burn the iso to the USB and skip to step 8.
4. On Linux, you'll want to follow the instructions below, pulled from here: [Preparing the Install File](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/23.10/gettingstarted/install/installingscale/#preparing-the-install-file)
5. Connect your empty USB drive and run this command in the terminal of the Linux machine you downloaded the TrueNAS iso to:
```
lsblk -po +vendor,model
```
6. In the ```NAME``` colum, you'll see the mount path of the USB. Use that in the command below:
```
dd status=progress if=path/to/.iso of=path/to/USB
```
7. Once this command completes, you'll have a bootable usb.
8. Plug this into your server, and enter bios (usually mashing something like F12 at the bootup screen)
9. In the BIOS screen, select the option to boot from your thumb drive. This should launch the TrueNAS Installer Console Setup. 


### Step Two: Install TrueNAS from USB and set up the administrator account
See here for the guide on first time setup of TrueNAS: [TrueNAS Installer Console Setup](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/gettingstarted/install/installingscale/#using-the-truenas-installer-console-setup)
1. Select **Install/Upgrade**

![SCALE Install Main Screen](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Install/SCALEInstallMainScreen.png)

2. Select the desired install drive

![SCALEInstallDriveScreen](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Install/SCALEInstallDriveScreen.png)
    
- You want to make sure you select the SSD drive you want to use as your boot drive

Select **Yes**.

![SCALEInstallWarningScreen](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Install/SCALEInstallWarningScreen.png)

3. Select **Fresh Install** to do a clean install of the downloaded version of TrueNAS SCALE. This erases the contents of the selected drive!

![SCALEInstallUpgradeFresh](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Install/SCALEInstallUpgradeFresh.png)

When the operating system device has enough additional space, you can choose to allocate some space for a swap partition to improve performance. Select **Create Swap** and press Enter.

![SCALEInstallPartitionScreen](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Install/SCALEInstallPartitionScreen.png)

When existing versions of TrueNAS are present on the device, you can choose **Install in new boot environment** to create a partition or **Format the boot device** to remove previous boot environments.

![SCALEInstallUpdateMethodSelection](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Install/SCALEInstallUpdateMethodSelection.png)

4. Select option **1 Administrative user (admin)** and then **OK** to install SCALE, and create the admin user account. SCALE Bluefin has implemented rootless login. Create an admin account and password. The system retains root as a fallback but it is no longer the default. This account has full control over TrueNAS and is used to log in to the web interface. Set a strong password and protect it. We do not recommend selecting **3 Configure using Web UI**.
![SCALEInstallerConsoleSetupAdminAccount](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Install/SCALEInstallerConsoleSetupAdminAccount.png)

Next, enter a password for the new admin user.

![SCALEInstallerConsoleSetupAdminPassword](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Install/SCALEInstallerConsoleSetupAdminPassword.png)

5. Select Boot via UEFI at the TrueNAS Boot Mode prompt, then select OK and press Enter to begin the installation.

After following the steps to install, reboot the system and remove the install media.

-----

### Step 3: Accessing the Web GUI
1. After removing the USB and rebooting the system, you should be presented with the Console Setup screen

![ConsoleSetupMenuSCALE](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/CLI/ConsoleSetupMenuSCALE.png)

2. At the top of this screen is the local IP address of the Web GUI

3. From any computer on the same network as your TrueNAS server, you should be able to enter that address and see the Web GUI Login Screen
    - For example, if your Web GUI is at ```https://192.168.1.10:443```, enter that into a web browser on a computer connected to the same network as your server
  
![LoginScreenSCALE](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Login/LoginScreenSCALE.png)

4. Enter the administrator username and password you set up in **Step Two**

5. At this point, you should be logged into the TrueNAS Web GUI!

6. Let's take a quick break, we've accomplished a lot at this point üòåüëçüèº

7. *After your break*, check this guide out for a detailed explaination of everything you can do in the Web GUI: [TrueNAS SCALE - UI Reference Guide](https://www.truenas.com/docs/scale/scaleuireference/) 

-----

### Step Four: Set up the SCALE Network

1. **Set up the TrueNAS Scale Network**
    - Go to *Network*, and for the interface (ethernet port) which is connected to the internet, all the way to the right, click the little pencil icon to Configure

![NetworkInterfacesWidget](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Network/NetworkInterfacesWidget.png)

- Under *Aliases*, set the IP Address to your desired local IP address for your server
    - This IP can or cannot be outside of your DHCP range
    - The DHCP range on your router is the range of IP addresses reserved for automatic assignment when someone new connects to the network
    - If you're going to run apps off of this server, you really should have a static IP
    - We'll set it here, in TrueNAS, then set it up on your router as well
- Save these settings

- Still in the *Network* tab of the Web GUI, click on *Settings* to the right of *Global Configuration*

![GlobalConfiguration](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Network/GlobalConfiguration.png)

- The *Hostname* and *Domain* define the local address of your server
    - The *Hostname* is the network name of your server
        - ```truenas``` is a typical choice  
    - The *Domain* is the network address of your server. You can enter additional domains as well
        - I like to start with ```truenas.local``` for the domain, and then if I have an external domain I would access remotely, I would add that under *Additional Domains*.  
    - For example, if you select ```truenas``` for *Hostname* and ```local``` for *Domain*, you can access your server at ```http://truenas.local```
- For *Nameserver 1* and *Nameserver 2*, you can use ```1.1.1.1``` and ```1.0.0.1```, these are Cloudfare's default DNS servers
    - When you get DNS services from Cloudfare, they give you special DNS domains for your server, you could use those too I guess, but I don't think it matters.
- For *IPv4 Default Gateway*, enter the IP address you would use to log into your router. That's your default gateway. For many, that's ```192.168.1.1```.
- For *Outbound Network*, make sure *Allow All* is selected.
- Save these settings.

![EditGlobalConfiguration](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Network/EditGlobalConfiguration.png)

2. **Set a static IP address for your server on your router**
    - This is the IP address you set for the interface above in Step 2
    - You typically also need the MAC address for your interface
    - You can get that running the command below in the TrueNAS shell under *System Settings*
    - You should a bunch of sections, one of them will be labeled with the name of the interface you set an IP address for in Step 2 above.
    - In that section, there should be a line that looks something like ```ether ax:3g:8c:04:07:v8```. That string of alphanumeric characters and colons is your MAC address
    - You may also need your hostname, which you also set in Step 2 above.
```
ifconfig -a
```

-----

### Step Five: Set up Terminal Access
- The idea here is that you're unlikely to have a monitor attached to your server at all times
- There is a Shell you can access via the web GUI, but you should not expose that to the internet, and it's a bit finicky
- So, without a monitor, how can you interact with the terminal? What if you're away from your desk?
- Enter SSH! You don't want to open your server up to the internet, but *if we can create a secure tunnel between the server and whatever machine we're on, that should be pretty secure*!
- I understand that SSH is cryptic for those unfamiliar with what it is or how it works, so I'll try to demystify the process

- The idea is that you, the client, wants to generate a set of keys, a *public key* and a *private key*
- The public key is like your address, it lets other people know who you are
- The private key is the secret algorithm that's used to encrypt your connection with whatever device you are connecting to, aka the server
> **NEVER SHARE YOUR PRIVATE KEY WITH ANYONE** ü§´

- See below for a helpful picture from [ssh.com](https://www.ssh.com). You are the client, trying to connect to the server via SSH.

![A visual of how SSH works...you are the client, trying to ssh into the server...](https://www.ssh.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/SSH_simplified_protocol_diagram-2.png)

Let's walk through the steps required to generate a set of host keys for your laptop, or desktop, or whatever device you want to use to connect to your server.
You can set up more than one device, but setting that up is a bit more complex. If you're here, you're probably not ready for all of that yet.
We're going to use OpenSSH, which is available by default on Linux or Mac. 

If you're on Windows, here's some helpful instructions for getting OpenSSH up and running on the command line: [Microsoft - OpenSSH instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=gui)
If you can't stand OpenSSH, there is also Putty, if you want, I guess.

1. **Forward a port for your SSH connection on your router**
    - This step is different for everyone depending on your router, search for ```Port forwarding <YourRouterNameAndModel>```
    - You'll want to forward *some port above 40000*,
       - ***Why are we doing this?*** Well, 22 is the default port for SSH connections, and it's a popular one for hackers to try and break into
       - We are going to keep that port closed, and open up another random port instead for SSH connections
       - This is more secure
    - Use TCP only,
    - For IP address to forward to, use the static IP address you selected for your server.
    - We'll come back to this port forwarding screen for your router to give other apps remote access as needed
  

3. **Set up the SSH Service in TrueNAS**
   - Go To *System Settings* -> *Services*

![ServicesSCALE](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/SystemSettings/ServicesSCALE.png)

   - Make sure the *SSH*, *NFS*, and *SMB* Services are *Running*, and are set to *Start Automatically*
   - On the *SSH* line, all the way to the right, click the little pencil icon to Configure SSH.
   - Set the TCP port for SSH to be *the port you forwarded on your router in Step 1*.
    - Enable *Allow TCP Port Forwarding*
    - Do NOT enable *Password Authentication*
        - **Why are we doing this?**
        - We are going to set up access via SSH, so we can keep our system extra secure by making sure the *only way* to access the system remotely is with a valid SSH key registered with the server
    - Save these settings

![ServicesSSHBasicSettingsGenOptionsSCALE](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/SystemSettings/ServicesSSHBasicSettingsGenOptionsSCALE.png)

4. **_On the client machine (the machine you'll be accessing the server from)_, generate an ssh key with ssh-keygen**
```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -c <your@email.address> -f /path/to/save/your/private/key
```
- **-t ed25519**: The encryption algorithm - this is the most advanced one available in OpenSSH
- **-c \<your@email.address\>**: Key comment - this will be appended to the end of your public key
    - it's for your records, it can be whatever you want, or you can omit it
- **-f /path/to/save/your/private/key**: The Private Key File Name - **This is the thing you don't want to share with anyone!**
    - The typical place to save these is in the ```.ssh``` directory.
    - This can be found in ```/home/<YourUsername>/.ssh/``` on Linux and MacOS
    - On Windows, this can be found in ```C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.ssh\```
    - I recommend naming the key something easy for you to remember. This helps to keep track of multiple keys.
        - For example, ```/home/<YourUsername>/.ssh/root@example.com```
        - This tells us we use this key to login to our server at ```example.com``` as the user ```root```.
    - OpenSSH will create an additonal file called **/path/to/save/your/private/key _.pub_**.
        - For example, if you named your private key  ```/home/<YourUsername>/.ssh/root@example.com```,
        - then your public key will be ```/home/<YourUsername>/.ssh/root@example.com.pub```
- After the key is generated, you'll see a cool ASCII graphic, then you'll be asked:

> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]

> Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]

- If you leave both of these fields empty, then your SSH key can be used without a password. **I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS**.
- Lock your key with a secure password. That way, no one can use your key to gain access to your server without that passphrase.

5. **Register your key with SSH Agent**
- Run the below command to get ssh-agent running:
```
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```

- You should see something like ```Agent pid 12345``` returned.
- Next, add the key to ssh-agent with the following command:
```
ssh-add /path/to/save/your/private/key
```
> You want to register your **private key** here, not the public one ending in *.pub*

     
6. **Still on the client machine, run the below command, which will return your client machine's public key**
```
cat /path/to/save/your/private/key.pub
```
- So, whatever your public key's name is, we are going to return its contents to the terminal screen
> Do NOT do this with your private key! ü§´
- Copy this by selecting it in the terminal, holding ```CTRL``` + ```SHIFT```, and press ```C```.
     
7. **Register this key with your admin account**
    - Note that if you are upgrading from a previous version of FreeNAS / TrueNAS, you're probably using hte ```root``` account as your admin account
    - This is being deprecated in future releases, so be prepared to use a separate admin account for all of your root stuff as this guide suggests eventually...
    - Go to  *Credentials* -> *Local Users*, and select your admin account for editing

![UserScreenUserDetails](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Credentials/UserScreenUserDetails.png)

- In this screen, we are going to paste the public key we copied in Step 5, and paste it in the *Authorized Keys* section

![AddUserHomeDirAuthSCALE](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Credentials/AddUserHomeDirAuthSCALE.png)

- Make sure *SSH Password Login* is **UNCHECKED**
    - **Why are we doing this**?
    - Wellll, we don't want to use passwords to gain SSH access with the server.
    - The only way in should be a secure key known by the server, further secured with a password on the client side.

8. **Now, you should be able to log into your server remotely using the command below**:
```
ssh <YourAdminAccount>@<YourServerDomain> -p <YourSSHPort>
```

-----

## Part II: Pool Setup
If you've been following along so far, you should be able to go to Storage in the TrueNAS GUI and see *at least* 3 unassigned disks.
One of those disks should be an SSD that's at least 256GB, and the other 2+ should be mechanical drives. 

### SSD Pool - where your apps will go
Click the **Create Pool** button in the ***Storage*** tab of the TrueNAS GUI.

1. **Select a name for your SSD pool**
    - People tend to choose something simple, all lower case without dashes or underscores
    - For the purpose of this tutorial, well assume this pool is called ```ssd```
    - Leave the drive unencrypted
    - Click *Next*

![PoolCreationWizardGeneralInfo](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Storage/PoolCreationWizardGeneralInfo.png)

2. **Add the SSD to your pool**
    - For *Layout*, select *Stripe*
    - Click *Manual Disk Selection* under *Advanced Options* 
    - In the top right corner, click *Add* to add the only VDEV we'll need for this pool
    - Select the SSD disk for your pool on the left, and drag it into your new VDEV on the right
    - If you have a lot of disks, feel free to use the disk filters to help parse down the list to find your disk
        - We will be setting up backups of our app directory, so disk redundancy isn't super necessary for this pool
        - If you must, you can set up a 2-way or 3-way mirrored VDEV
    - Click *Save Selection*, then click *Save and Go To Review*
     
![ManualSelectionScreen](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Storage/ManualSelectionScreen.png)

3. **Review your selection and create your pool**
    - *Pool Name* should be what we set above, (eg ```ssd``` as in our example)
    - *Data* under *Topology* should say something like ```1 x STRIPE|1 x #.## GiB (SSD)```
    - If everything looks good, go ahead and click *Create Pool*

![PoolCreationWizardReviewScreen](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Storage/PoolCreationWizardReviewScreen.png)

### Storage Pool - where your data will go
At this point, we assume you have at least 2 unassigned disks left, all mechanical drives.
For your storage pool, consider RAIDZ1/2/3 or mirrored VDEVs
  - Internet searches will produce many opinions on whether you should go with Z1/2/3 or mirrored pools.
  - Basically, mirrored pools sacrifice capacity (at least half of your space will be redundancy) in exchange for speed
  - In terms of redundancy, RAIDZ2 is probably ideal
  - In terms of performance, mirrored vdevs are faster, and I personally use them


1. **Select a name for your storage pool**
    - People tend to choose something simple, all lower case without dashes or underscores
    - For the purpose of this tutorial, well assume this pool is called ```storage```
    - Leave the drive unencrypted
    - Click *Next*
  
2. **Add the HDDs to your storagepool**
    - For *Layout*, select your chosen redundancy framework (hopefully NOT Stripe if you've been listening to me!)
    - Under *Automated Disk Selection*, select the *Disk Size* that matches the size of your mechanical drives
    - Under *Width*, this depends on your redundancy framework
        - RAID Z1/2/3 is essentially 1 VDEV per pool
        - Mirrored will create one VDEV per mirror
        - Mirrors need to have at least two disks per VDEV
        - So for a 2 way mirror (50% of HDD capacity spent on redundancy), select *2* for *Width*
        - For a 3 way mirror (66.7% of HDD capacity spent on redundancy), select *3* for *Width*
    - The *Number of VDEVs* will be limited by the number of disks you have and your redundancy framework
    - Click *Save and Go To Review*
  
![PoolCreationWizardDataScreen](https://www.truenas.com/docs/images/SCALE/Storage/PoolCreationWizardDataScreen.png)

3. **Review your selection and create your pool**
    - *Pool Name* should be what we set above, (eg ```storage``` as in our example)
    - *Data* under *Topology* should say something like ```<V> x STRIPE| <W> x #.## GiB (SSD)```
        - <V> represents the number of VDEVs in your pool
        - <W> represents the width you selected
    - If everything looks good, go ahead and click *Create Pool*

## Part III: Set up the Apps Cluster

-----

### Step One: Setup your Apps Pool
    - You want this to be a pool with at least one SSD drive, with at least 250GB
    - Follow [this guide] from TrueNAS to get your pool operational

### Step Two: Reverse Proxy

### Step Three: Single Sign On

### Step Four: Installing other apps
